4/13 - David Hjelmstad informed us he was no longer enrolled in the class and would be leaving our group. 
	Given the integral nature of the code David was working on for deliverable 2, we will not have a complete 
	deliverable to turn in on 4/15. As discussed with Dr. Calliss after class on 4/15, we will be submitting 
	what we have so far anyways for code and updated documentation.
