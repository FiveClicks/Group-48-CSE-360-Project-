To run the game:

Download every file in the folder "New-UI-Game1-Player" and run Driver.java. Make sure the statistics.txt file is located
in the project folder.


Testing:

We have JUnit tests for some methods in Game1 and Die. In order to test the other components of the game, we couldn't
use the unit tests and, rather, we ran the game and fored certain situations to test for the right reaction. The documentation
of those tests are in the folder labeled "TestCases"
